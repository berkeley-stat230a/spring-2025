# About Stat 230a

Theory of least squares estimation, interval estimation, and tests under the general linear fixed effects model with normally distributed errors. Large sample theory for non-normal linear models. Two and higher way layouts, residual analysis. Effects of departures from the underlying assumptions. Robust alternatives to least squares. 


(goals)=
## Goals

By the end of the semester you should be able to:

- Understand and interpret ordinary least squares regression models from a mathematical perspective.

- Adapt the basic regression model to common practical complications including violations of standard assumptions, high-dimensional regimes, and non-continuous outcomes.

- Evaluate the quality of a regression analysis in context and suggest improvements.

- Use R or Python to fit, report, and clearly communicate the process and results of a regression
analysis.

(prerequisites)=
## Prerequisites

- Masterâ€™s level probability at the level of STAT 201A.

- Linear algebra, at the level of the appendix in the course notes (Math 110 or equivalent).

- R or Python coding fluency.
